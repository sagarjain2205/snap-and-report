## 🌍 Problem Statement

Illegal parking is a **major issue across India 🇮🇳** — causing traffic congestion, blocking emergency routes, and creating unsafe road conditions.

Even after reporting:

* ❌ Long manual complaint processes
* ⏳ Delayed resolution
* 🏢 Physical visits to police stations

👉 There was no **simple, digital, real-time solution**

---

## 💡 Solution

**Snap & Report** is a full-stack AI-powered system that:

* 📸 Lets citizens report violations instantly
* 🤖 Uses AI to detect number plates
* 👮 Routes reports to relevant officers
* 💰 Enables digital challan generation

## ⚙️ System Workflow

```text
User uploads vehicle image 📸
        ↓
Image stored on Cloudinary ☁️
        ↓
Backend sends image URL to ML API (HuggingFace)
        ↓
YOLOv8 + EasyOCR detect number plate 🤖
        ↓
Report saved in MongoDB 🗄️
        ↓
Assigned officer verifies 👮
        ↓
Challan generated 💰
```

## 🧠 AI / ML Pipeline

* 🤖 **YOLOv8** → Detects vehicle & plate region
* 🔍 **EasyOCR** → Extracts number plate text
* ☁️ **HuggingFace Spaces (Docker)** → ML deployment
* 🔗 Backend communicates via REST API

👉 Fully decoupled ML microservice architecture ⚡
